  An ape trying to make sense.
  Feels peace, joy and love
  but also sorrow, anger and solitude.

  Tries to understand,
  gets lost.
  Feel sad about
  when once felt peace.

  That is the music of life:
  it's full of everything.
  Maybe not made to be understood.

  That is me:
  People, Dance, Software, Arts,
  Music, Sports, Traveling, People,
  People and a bunch of other things.

  Lies.
  An ape can not be that simple to define.
  Or are we?

  Searching.
  I'm searching.
  Although, maybe there is nothing to be found.
  And everything that I need is already here.
