It may contain spoilers.

The following are my reviews for Dostoevsky's short stories.

It may also include bigger novels that I simply do not want to write a separated post for it.

## White Nights

Ok, I quite didn't grasp most of the guy's monologue about himself. I simply couldn't understand what he was talking about lol.

The ending was at least a bit funny.

Recommended for a fast read riding on a bus when you don't have anything else to read.

> Read context: end of August 2025

## Faint Heart

This one is funny and overall interesting.

Two best friends living together, one of them has some emotional problems and he just gets CRAZY for getting engaged with a woman.
Literally, he gets totally lost on his own thoughts and emotions.

Recommended.

> Read context: somewhere in September 2025, in a family trip

## A Christmas Tree and a Wedding

Good, not bad, not great. A simple story.

> Read context: near 2025 Christmas (just a coincidence) at home
