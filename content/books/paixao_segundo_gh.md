> vida humanizada. Eu havia humanizado demais a vida.

It was quite hard to read this book. I don't know why.
It took me probably one month to read it. Not that I was reading it every day but
some days I would just skip it and not read it because I know it wouldn't be an easy thing haha.

Maybe the monologue was just too subjective or the words-dance was too complex for my ape brain.

Maybe I was not prepared for it now, technically speaking. I'm used to easy readings.

Anyway, it was a good book. I was not expecting it to be a book about existence, reality and life.

I was expecting a book about romance and love between people haha but no, it was far from that.

It was more about love toward all the things, all the people and the present moment, the now.

It reminded me of the book "The Power of Now" and all the concept of mindfulness, of living the now and
only the now.

Because the book was basically about that:

A woman transcending her "common" way of living, her way of thinking about the world, arriving at the conclusion
that only one thing matters: the now, the present moment.

I'll probably reread it again in some years.

Recommended if you are fond of existentialism, meaning or just seeing other perspectives on how to handle life.
