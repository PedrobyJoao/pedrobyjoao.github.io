Maybe spoiler alert I guess (The Island, Aldous Huxley)

Really, from all books that I read, all TV shows that I watched..
this is the only passage that really stuck with me in terms of memorizing small parts of it.

Sometimes, when I see myself taking things too seriously, I start to ramble with myself parts of it.

Context: Lakshmi is an old woman and she is dying. And Susila is a younger lady.

Here it goes:

> It's dark because you're trying too hard," said Susila.
> "Dark because you want it to be light.
> Remember what you used to tell me when I was a little girl.
> 'Lightly, child, lightly. You've got to learn to do everything lightly.
> Think lightly, act lightly, feel lightly. Yes, feel lightly, even though you're feeling deeply.
> Just lightly let things happen and lightly cope with them.'
> I was so preposterously serious in those days, such a humorless little prig.
> Lightly, lightlyâ€”it was the best advice ever given me.
> Well, now I'm going to say the same thing to you, Lakshmi . . . Lightly, my darling, lightly.
> Even when it comes to dying. Nothing ponderous, or portentous, or emphatic.
> No rhetoric, no tremolos, no self-conscious persona putting on its celebrated imitation
> of Christ or Goethe or Little Nell. And, of course, no theology, no metaphysics.
> Just the fact of dying and the fact of the Clear Light. So throw away all your baggage and go forward.
> There are quicksands all about you, sucking at your feet, trying to suck you down into fear and
> self-pity and despair. That's why you must walk so lightly. Lightly, my darling. On tiptoes;
> and no luggage, not even a sponge bag. Completely unencumbered
>
> The Island, Aldous Huxley
