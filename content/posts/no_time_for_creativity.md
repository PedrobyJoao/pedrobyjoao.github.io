Work, adult responsibilities, family/friends, workout, exercises, books, journaling, music...

How da hell can I find time to let my engineering creativity flow?

I have so many projects in mind that I would love to do but I never manage to spend more than 1 day in a week
putting the effort to do it. And it's not because I do not have fun doing so, I actually have.

But... it's so many things happening in life at the same time. From all the things that I mentioned, I could only really
sacrifice music. But I'm not sure if that would be enough.

Adult responsibilities is the one that most require efforts, holyyyyy...

I just wanted to get this off my chest.

I hope I can better organize my day, the things that I plan are very cool.

It doesn't help but I have so many ideas, and sometimes I can't just focus on one.

I was going through the Software Foundations book which was really cool but somewhat hard sometimes, but then I would spend an entire week
without doing because I had other responsibilities to deal with.

And then, now I have like 5-7 ideas of what to study or projects to work on and they're all so cool that I don't know what to do first,
and in the end I don't do anything at all :/

Here are some projects/studies that I had in mind:

- p2p messenger app using Erlang
- Decentralized and story building with consensus
- painting colors and forms based on music notes (this one I started and worked for a while using elm)
- software foundations
- simply trying to learn everything necessary to understand Taelin's X posts, in practice (I say in practice,
  because Software Foundations was my tentative of doing this following a book). (lambda calculus,
  type theory, and I'd probably try to implement a Interaction combinator evaluator)
- AI assistant (like Mycroft, Neon...)
- Android app to block apps (I know that some already exist in the playstore but since I couldn't find a reliable open source alternative)

anyway, it doesn't matter. To be honest, I listed the projects for myself, not for you reader. I have to keep track of them since sometimes I just forget some.

I really would like to work on these things, it's very sad that I'm not.

The last time that I did something really cool until the end was building a [complete 16-bit computer](https://github.com/PedrobyJoao/16-bit-computer) but here I'm, doing nothing,
compressing my engineering creativity within my heart and soul, just watching other people build cool things while I...
