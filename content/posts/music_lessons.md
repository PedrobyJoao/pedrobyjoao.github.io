_Disclaimer_: I'm a very bad music player (I won't even call myself musician) but I wandered around a lot of
blog articles and youtube videos, looking for the best learning resources... so here I have gathered the ones I find
the best.

For those also trying to learn music, this post is a collection of music learning resources that
I found to be very very very useful in the middle of so many available options on the internet.

### "Learn music theory in half an hour", Andrew Huang

First, you _won't_ learn music theory in half an hour lol.

If completely following the video learning strategy, it would actually take some _days_.

If you're someone who better learns practicing in your own, just go with it.

It has theory concepts and **exercises to help you practice alone**.

And the best part is that the exercises are not very well defined,
it's you that should choose what to practice given what was learned.

### Charly Sauret, music theory

This is far the best music theory learning resource that I already come across.

Just go for it if you want to understand the most _fundamental_ concepts of music.
