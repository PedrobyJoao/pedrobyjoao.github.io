I'm almost finalizing _On the road by Jack Kerouac_, and probably like most of its readers, I feel like getting my car and drive randomly through anywhere really. Going mad for a while.
By the way, I read the original scroll so there are no paragraphs here either haha. Anyway, I could feel the urge popping into my brain of calling one of my friends, who also read
On the road (we have a book club), and simply go. Go where? What is the plan? None. But you know, Jack, Neal and colleagues are too mad, I'm no way with the intention of going mad like them,
abusing on alcohol, stealing cars or having multiple children with one-month lovers. No, that is not what I'm urging for. I'm urging for the road, for the randomness of what can happen day
to day. What kind of people would I get to know? What parties would I dance? What foods would I like and what others would I do not like? What kind of things me and my friend would argue about since
every human relationship has conflicts? I'm just afraid of feeling too much back pain driving too much, and also afraid of being too far away from my family. So, I don't know if I'll crazily get in the car
and just drive away. Maybe I should enjoy this phase of my life now because I know it'll be over soon. Don't get me wrong, I like adventures, randomness.. but I'm more inclined to live in a few places calmly,
in meditation-like routines. Not that I can not get this from a road trip but you understand what I'm trying to say. This will of adventure, the current weight of adult responsibilities that I have (no children yet) are
ephemeral like everything else, if I don't enjoy this now, it might happen that I'll never have the chance to. Does everyone have to go on the road (if possible)? Of course not. It's not a necessary lifestyle, at least
not for me, I can be happy without it, I can enjoy life without it sure. But, for no other reason than that, I just feel going any soon. Simply. I wanna do it and that is enough reason. I'm noticing that I do not stick
to the same life philosophies for too long, actually I didn't have that many but here I'm, going on the opposite side from what I used to believe: anywhere, anytime, you can feel peace it just depends on your inner attention
to reality, to the moment. And I still believe that, I really do. Again, the trip is not in anyway necessary. Also, now that I stopped to think about it, the trip is also not contradicting that much what I think about life,
I can still stick to the moment, paying close attention to whatever happens, dealing with what happens outside of my control... yep, I don't know why I had this feeling that going on this random trip would go against my
rationals on life-philosophy. Anyway, I'm going too far away from the goal of this blog post, I'm just here too scream how much I'm getting inspired by Neal Cassady, Jack Kerouac and their gang. Travelling with a good friend companion,
dancing, listening to some good music around random bars, getting to know random people. Simply enjoing the randomness of the modern civilization.
