## Why I Decided to Make This Post

I would really like to do this post on love before reading more books about love.
Because that's what I'm doing now - I already read The Symposium, I will read Phaedrus from Plato,
and I also may read Kierkegaard on the works of love, and some other books.

So I would like to do my post first, before being influenced by the thoughts of other apes.

And that's why I'm doing this now.

## What is Love?

That's a very hard question to answer, like most of the questions related directly to the subjectivity
of human mind and society.

I will probably not completely answer this here. Actually, I do not think anyone in the world, neither an AGI,
can really answer this because the thing about humans is that each one of us is interpreting reality
as we think it is the correct way.

Love is just a word - as we have this thing called language, words are not really totally effective to completely
express our thoughts. It is not possible through words. Words are very very abstracted
from what we individually are perceiving and interpreting from reality.

So when we are talking about love, we are of course just talking
about a high level abstraction of this word, of the abstracted concept that this word represents.

Just giving a glimpse on the topic of reality..

I do not think that we humans are really perceiving reality directly, the pure reality - we are not.
We are perceiving an interpretation of reality interpreted by our brain, that is what is happening.

Ok, but coming back to love (I will do a post about reality later). By the way, I am not a physicist or a
philosopher, I am just an ape trying to understand reality with the things that I superficially know.

Now really coming back to love...

I cannot define love for everyone, I cannot define an absolute meaning of love.

What I will try to do here is to define love giving my interpretation on how I perceive and interpret reality.

## Stepping back: Ways of Love

But it is really hard, as I said, to describe, to try to explain and make an post on a word. The subjectivity
of human mind is already very complex, even more for a word, a word that represents an emotion, or something
similar.

So I think it is easier first to define what is not love for me, or at least not fully love, and that's what I will do now.

Also, I'll talk about things that may or not be considered love.

Some things might be related to love, but they are the full meaning of love. They do not represent the whole concept
of this emotion.

For the next subtopics, I'll be talking about the **ideal** concepts of each type of relationship.

### Marriage: is not just about love

> Anyway, I'm talking about **my concept of an ideal marriage**

First, marriage is not only about love, is not love by itself. It can contain love, but not necessarily.

At least ideally, for me, marriage is mostly about partnership between two apes trying to survive this reality
while alive, plus love.

And here, still on marriage, **maybe** love is somewhat optional. Because the main part of marriage is about
partnership between two people on how to raise children, how to survive financially in our society, how to
keep each other well physically and emotionally.

> Of course that they do need to get well and respect each other but not necessarily **love** each other.
>
> But what is love anyway?

Most usually, this will involve love, but not necessarily.

Naturally, when two humans have a strong and successful partnership where there is respect, care and they get along well,
love will probably be present too.

And again, I'm talking about my idealization on what marriage should be made of.

And when I talk about marriage, of course, I can also extend to **romantic relationships** that are not
necessarily marriage.

### Romantic relationships: Not the ONLY way of Love

> Note on what happens in practice: people in romantic relationships might or not be in love with each other.
> They usually think they're, but sometimes they're not, and sometimes some of them are even aware of that.

> For the following, I'm considering romantic relationships where people are really in love with each other.

What do I mean with **romantic relationships**?

It **necessarily contains love**, care and a different intimacy comparing with other kinds of relationships.

I don't need to extend on how this intimacy works, you can already imagine though some details may
depend on the culture you're inserted.

Romantic love is cool, it's the source of many poems and other kinds of art.

Beautiful it's, I'm not sure if I'm on the same page of other people. Here it how it goes:

**People usually think of romantic love as a superior way of love.**

**I'm not sure if that's true.**

Anyway, I'll talk more about that later.

## Can we love things other than people?

Yes, I think I would say yes. Like, you really can love some hobbies. Like, I see some people that are very
in love with programming. They create softwares all day, that's the only thing that they do on life.
They would do it for free, some of them are doing it for free. And they are just having much fun.

> You can also think about people who love music.

**But wait! Is having fun with something the same as being in love?**

So, I will leave this question open. I'm not sure if we can be in love with things or hobbies. Things that
we like to do, you know. Like music. I won't give you an answer on that, because I'm not sure either. I
think that's also not the main point that I'd like to bring here on this post.

But most probably, yes, we can be in love with other things, not just with people. Like being in love with
places that we know or with a hobby... Being in love with living, just living life. Being in love with reality.

So, actually, going the opposite direction that I went, I would actually say that, yes. Actually, most
probably, **yes, we can love things that are not people.**

But I think my post will be focused on the love between people.

## Is romantic love superior than love for other people?

Most of people treat as it was.

I'm not sure. For a while, I was sure that it was not the case. Maybe I don't have this certainty anymore because I was
primed by the thoughts of everyone around me.

Maybe that is just cultural, seeing romantic love as superior. Culture which may be a consequence of our survival instincts
of procration, and the
