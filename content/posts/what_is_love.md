## Why I Decided to Make This Eulogy

The reason is that I just like to wonder about things on the universe, on our reality. On my individual reality.

I would really like to do this eulogy on love before reading more books about love.
Because that's what I'm doing now - I already read The Symposium, I will read Phaedrus from Plato,
and I also may read Kierkegaard on the works of love, and some other books.

So I would like to do my eulogy first, before being influenced by the thoughts of other apes.

And that's why I'm doing this now.

## What is Love?

That's a very hard question to answer, like most of the questions related directly to the subjectivity
of human mind and society.

I will probably not completely answer this here. Actually, I do not think anyone in the world, neither an AGI,
can really answer this because the thing about humans and minds is that each one of us is interpreting reality
as we think it is the right way.

Love is just a word - as we have this thing called language, words are not really totally effective to completely
express our thoughts. It is not possible through words. Words are very very abstracted
from what we individually are perceiving and interpreting from reality.
So when we are talking about love, we are of course just talking
about a high level abstraction of this word, of the abstracted concept that this word represents.

Actually, not today, but someday I will talk about what I think about reality and what I think about our
perception of reality, because this is kind of related to what I just said about love being just an abstraction
and that everyone interprets reality in a different way.

So here, just glimpsing a little bit on the topic of reality..

I do not think that we humans are really perceiving reality directly, the pure reality - we are not.
We are perceiving an interpretation of reality interpreted by our brain, that is what is happening.

Ok, but coming back to love (I will do a post about reality later). By the way, I am not a physicist or a
philosopher, I am just an ape trying to understand reality with the things that I superficially know.

Now really coming back to love...

I cannot define love for everyone, I cannot define an absolute meaning of love.

What I will try to do here is to define love giving my interpretation on how I perceive and interpret reality.

## Stepping back: What is NOT Love?

But it is really hard, as I said, to describe, to try to explain and make an eulogy on a word. The subjectivity
of human mind is already very complex, even more for a word, a word that represents an emotion, or something
similar.

So I think it is easier first to define what is not love for me, and that's what I will do now.

So, I would like to separate some concepts that people in our society think about love that I do not agree.

Some things might be related to love, but they are the full meaning of love. They do not represent the whole concept
of this emotion.

For the next subtopics, I'll be talking about the **ideal** concepts of each type of relationship.

### Marriage: Not necessarily Love

> Note, what happens in practice: married people might or not be in love with each other.
> They usually think they're, but sometimes they're not, and sometimes some of them are even aware of that.
>
> Anyway, I'm talking about my concept of an ideal marriage

First, marriage is not only about love, is not love by itself. It can contain love, but not necessarily.

At least ideally, for me, marriage is mostly about partnership between two apes trying to survive this reality
while alive, plus love.

And here, still on marriage, maybe love is somewhat optional. Because the main part of marriage is about
partnership between two people on how to raise children, how to survive financially in our society, how to
keep each other well physically and emotionally.

> Of course that they do need to get well and respect each other but not necessarily **love** each other.

Most usually, this involves love, but not necessarily. And again, I'm talking about an **ideal marriage**. I'm not
talking about all the marriages that exist in the world. I'm talking about an ideal.

> Also, on my ideal concept of marriage, being in love is SUPER **prefered**.
>
> Wouldn't be a perfect scenario to marry someone whose you're both great partners and lovers?

And when I talk about marriage, of course, I can also extend to **romantic relationships** that are not
necessarily marriage, like having a girlfriend or boyfriend.

### Romantic relationships: Not the ONLY way of Love

> Note, what happens in practice: people in romantic relationships might or not be in love with each other.
> They usually think they're, but sometimes they're not, and sometimes some of them are even aware of that.
>
> For the following, I'm considering romantic relationships where people are really in love with each other.

That, I think, is one of the ways of love. It is not necessarily the only one, but people interpret it as so.

When someone says "I'm in love", people already interpret that this someone is in love with another person
in a romantic way.

Usually people think of romantic love as a superior way of love. And I'm not sure if that's true.
And that's the main point here.

## Romantic Love: what is the difference?

TODO: is romantic relationships a superior way of love?

TODO: what does it differ from love for other people?

## What is Love then?

TODO

## Is Love (for/from people) a MUST to live a good life?

TODO

## How do you know you're in love to someone?

TODO

## Can we love "things" and actions?

Yes, I think I would say yes. Like, you really can love some hobbies. Like, I see some people that are very
in love with programming. They create softwares all day, that's the only thing that they do on life.
They would do it for free, some of them are doing it for free. And they are just having much fun.

**But wait! Is having fun with something the same as being in love?**

So, I will leave this question open. I'm not sure if we can be in love with things or hobbies. Things that
we like to do, you know. Like music. I won't give you an answer on that, because I'm not sure either. I
think that's also not the main point that I'd like to bring here on this eulogy.

But most probably, yes, we can be in love with other things, not just with people. Like being in love with
places that we know or with a hobby... Being in love with living, just living life. Being in love with reality.

So, actually, going the opposite direction that I went, I would actually say that, yes. Actually, most
probably, **yes, we can love things that are not people.**

But I think my eulogy will be focused on the love between people.
