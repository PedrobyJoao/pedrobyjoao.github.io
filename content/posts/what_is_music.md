## Intro

How music works? What is exactly music?

I've been trying to understand how music works, guessing that there are mathematical
relations providing pleasure to our brains.

Also, I mistakenly thought that there were some frequencies that our brain liked more than others.

I then started investigating how the frequencies between notes relate to each other.
Noticing that the octave interval signifies doubling a certain frequency (e.g.: `A4` is 440.00 Hz
and `A5` is 880.00 Hz).

However, playing with an LLM, when asking about frequencies, ratio between semitones/tones... I realized
that I was not actually investigating **Music** in general. I was actually learning about
**Western Music**!!!

## Notes, frequencies and standards

There is no universal music standard!

Not all music systems rely on a note with `440.00 Hz`. And, obviously, not all systems have
the same well-known western notes `A B C D E F G`.

Heck, not all systems have the concept of octaves (it seems most of them have though).

## 12-TET: 12-tone equal temperament

It's usually associated with what we know by Western Music.

On this system, there are 12 semitones per octave:

`A Bb B C Dd D E F Gg G Aa A`

A system with an octave intervals provides a geometric ratio of 2:1
between the "same" notes on different intervals.

`A4`, note `A` on the fourth octave has as its standard frequency `440.00 Hz`.
For the next octave, fifth, the note `A5` has its standard frequency equal to `880.00 Hz`

However, although there are frequency standards for this system, not all
"western" music is played using the default frequencies.

It seems some orchestras deviates a bit and play, for example, `A4` as `442.00 Hz`
instead of the standard `440.00 Hz`.

Also, historically, prior to the late 19th century, there was not a pitch standard,
so some places in Europe would have `A4` as 415.00 Hz while others 465.00 Hz.
