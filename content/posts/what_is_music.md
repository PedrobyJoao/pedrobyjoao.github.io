The initial 3 notes of _Do I Wanna Know_ are: F G A#

If you transpose the same rhythm with random notes, it won't sound like _Do I Wanna Know_ obviously.

However, keeping the same fingers position on the fretboard, we can move to whatever part of the fretboard,
it'll sound like _Do I Wanna Know_ even though it may sound strange in some cases, it's still recognizable.

Sound is just frequency.

And music is just a sequence and/or a group of different frequencies with arbitrary intervals between them
that sounds cool to our brain for some neurological reason.

Ok but back to _Do I Wanna Know_. Just transposing the hands position throughout the fretboard, the song is still
recognizable. Why?

My guess is that each sequence/group of frequencies (aka music) bring with itself _a mathematical signature_ which
is defined by the frequencies, intervals and how they're blend together.

So `F G A#` played in a certain rhythm has this mathematical relation of frequencies uniqueness that is abstracted
by our brains.

Therefore, when we transpose our hand to another part of the fretboard keeping the same fingers position and playing
with the same rhythm, the _mathematical signature is still the same!_ The only difference is the frequencies being used.

So let's investigate this mathematical underlying concepts of music!!!

TODO: an ongoing investigation is happening. I'll keep the draft visible because just the question made here
is interesting enough.
