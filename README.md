### JP, the ape

My blogs with my random thoughts.

> What is random?

I don't know.

> What are thoughts?

It's already 10p.m., I just want to finish the initial setup of my blog. So my initial answer for this is: I'm just an ape,
of course I don't know what are thoughts.

### TODOs (important)

- [ ] backup of my blog posts

### TODOs (secondary)

- [ ] self hosted web server
- [ ] custom domain
- [ ] backup of content on Arweave (or other _permanent_ DSN)
- [ ] funny 404 (ape)
- [ ] Psychedelic/Apes background alternative
- [ ] allow comments (limmited to 'n') (that is for the far future btw)

### Theme

Theme: https://github.com/tomfran/typo

What is a theme? Something made by other ape which helped me to save hours of my life.

Thanks, Francesco.
